# proto-town
A side scrolling town management game.

### About
I created this game more as a programming project than for the game. Hence I only use one library, SFML which provides a good
interface to work with things outside the program, such as the screen and keyboard, but little else. Everything else is part of
the language standard or something I made myself.

### To-Do
Some of the next steps for this game.
* Get Mob-Tile colitions working in a more refined manner.
* Add some construct that can be placed on tiles.
* Add a interation mechanic so the player can interact with things near them.
